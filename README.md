## 📜 Smart Contract Architecture

The Move smart contract at the core of AptosBountyBoard orchestrates the following functions:

- **Bounty Lifecycle Management:** Creation, modification, and termination of bounties with on-chain fund locking  
- **Submission & Review:** Developers submit deliverables which undergo community and owner review  
- **Conflict Arbitration:** Transparent, decentralized voting resolves disputes equitably  
- **Funds Release & Distribution:** Conditional release of locked funds triggered by voting outcomes  
- **State & Role Tracking:** Maintains secure records of bounty status and participant roles for auditability  

This architecture ensures a trustless, tamper-resistant environment, fostering confidence among all stakeholders.
